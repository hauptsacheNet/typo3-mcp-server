# TYPO3 MCP Server Extension

**‚ö†Ô∏è This extension is a work in progress and under active development.**

This extension provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for TYPO3 that allows
AI assistants to safely view and manipulate TYPO3 pages and records through TYPO3's workspace system.

## üîí Safe AI Content Management with Workspaces

**All content changes are automatically queued in TYPO3 workspaces**, making it completely safe for AI assistants to create, update, and modify content without immediately affecting your live website. Changes require explicit publishing to become visible to site visitors.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard protocol for connecting AI systems with external tools and data sources.
It enables AI assistants to interact with systems in a structured way, providing capabilities like:

- Executing commands and tools
- Accessing resources
- Creating and retrieving content

## Features

### Core MCP Capabilities
- CLI command that starts an MCP server
- Tools for listing TYPO3 page trees
- Tools for viewing TYPO3 record details
- Tools for modifying TYPO3 records via DataHandler
- Secure authentication and permission handling

### Workspace Safety Features
- **Automatic workspace selection** - Finds or creates optimal workspace for content changes
- **Workspace-only operations** - Only exposes tables that support safe workspace operations
- **Protected system tables** - Prevents modification of critical system configuration
- **Transparent workspace context** - All read operations respect workspace state
- **Publishing workflow** - Changes require explicit approval before going live

### Publishing Workflow

1. AI creates/modifies content in workspace
2. Content appears in TYPO3 Backend ‚Üí Workspaces module
3. Editors review and approve changes
4. Content is published to live site
5. Workspace is cleared for next round of changes

This approach combines the power of AI automation with human oversight and TYPO3's proven content management workflows.

## Installation

```bash
composer require hn/mcp-server
```

**Requirements:**
- TYPO3 v12.4+ or v13.4+
- TYPO3 Workspaces extension (automatically installed as dependency)

## Usage

### Quick Start

There are two ways to connect AI assistants like Claude Desktop to your TYPO3 installation:

#### Option 1: Local Command Line Connection

This method gives you admin privileges by default. Add this to your mcp config file of Claude Desktop or whatever client you are using.
```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
      "[your-typo3-name]": {
         "command": "php",
         "args": [
            "vendor/bin/typo3",
            "mcp:server"
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

#### Option 2: OAuth Authentication (Recommended)

For secure remote access with proper authentication:

1. Go to **[Username] ‚Üí MCP Server** in your TYPO3 backend
2. Copy the OAuth configuration from the "OAuth Client Configuration" section
3. Add it to your Claude Desktop configuration file

The OAuth setup:
- Provides secure authentication through TYPO3 backend login
- Supports multiple simultaneous client connections per user
- Includes proper token management and revocation
- Works with any MCP client that supports OAuth 2.1

**OAuth Flow:**
1. MCP client redirects you to TYPO3 authorization URL
2. You log in to TYPO3 backend (if not already logged in)  
3. You authorize the MCP client access
4. TYPO3 generates a secure access token
5. MCP client uses the token for API access

#### Next Steps

3. Begin creating content - all changes will be safely queued in workspaces

4. Review and publish changes through TYPO3 Backend ‚Üí Workspaces module

### CLI OAuth Management

For advanced users and automation, you can manage OAuth tokens via command line:

```bash
# Generate authorization URL for a user
vendor/bin/typo3 mcp:oauth url admin --client-name="My MCP Client"

# List active tokens for a user  
vendor/bin/typo3 mcp:oauth list admin

# Revoke a specific token
vendor/bin/typo3 mcp:oauth revoke admin --token-id=123

# Revoke all tokens for a user
vendor/bin/typo3 mcp:oauth revoke admin --all

# Clean up expired tokens and codes
vendor/bin/typo3 mcp:oauth cleanup
```

## Development

### Adding New Tools

Tools are defined in the `Classes/MCP/Tools` directory. Each tool follows the MCP tool specification and maps to specific TYPO3 functionality.
